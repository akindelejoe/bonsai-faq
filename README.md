# bonsai-faq
I just built and deployed a responsive FAQ page for a fictional bonsai shop using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery!

 It features an interactive accordion for questions, smooth transitions, and mobile responsiveness.

üõ†Ô∏è Built with:
- HTML5 & CSS3
- jQuery for dynamic UI
- GitHub Pages for deployment

This project helped me strengthen my frontend fundamentals and DOM scripting. Excited to build more!
